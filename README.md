# VOB_to_MP4_converter

This project helps converting your old DVD's into MP4 to preserve your treasures.

## Usage:

ATTENTION:
 - The preset is for computers with a nvidia graphic-card
 - Use ```-options``` and then ```-disable nvidia``` if there is no supported graphic-card
 - ```-help``` will show all options

To convert:
- Just copy and paste the full path of the folder with the VOB files
- If the VOB Files have standard-names it will seperate them in their different parts
- If not will it create ```ONE``` big MP4 file of all VOB files in that folder
- If you want to convert just one file enter the full path of that file
